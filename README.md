### Disclaimers
I'd Like to state that this is basically a 'recreation' of the Vercel template on the topic, with the sole goal of being a learning experience. 

 - [Next.js Shopify Storefront API Example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce)

That being said, it was great to learn about API integration, data fetching integration with type definitions.
