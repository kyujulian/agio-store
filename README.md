This is a Shopify powered E-commerce website application created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

and deployed at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

It is a fully functional E-commerce website with the following features:

 - [x] Product Listing
 - [x] Searching and Sorting
 - [x] Cart Management using cookies
 - [x] Secure Checkout using Shopify Checkout API
 - [x] Order Management using Shopify Admin API
 - [x] Product variation support and inventory management



### Disclaimers
I'd Like to state that most of this code is taken from / inspired by a Vercel template on the topic.

 - [Next.js Shopify Storefront API Example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce)

That being said, it was great to learn about API integration, data fetching integration with type definitions.
